SPATIAL GREENHOUSE

The project will consist on two parts:
The first one lets you configurate your greenhouse modules depending on a number of variables and generates some building layers and diagrams.
The second one aggregates a standard module and calculates the percentage of food produced depending on the number of modules and astronauts in the station.

Extra: crop species and numeric values as metadata

PART02:
